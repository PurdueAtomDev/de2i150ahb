	README - Brief description of the directory layout and files needed
*******************************************************************************


This directory has the following layout :

./
	ahb_slave_with_pcie	- Synthesis/Simulation files for Qsys module. Needs to be a part of your quartus project.
	linux_app_sample_amba		- contains app.c, the Software to use your FPGA design
	<bunch of other files>		- Explained below

<bunch of other files>
1. EP4CGX150DF31.qsf 	- This is a pin assignment file to be used in your
quartus project.  Very imporant file.
2. SEG_HEX.v	    	- LCD Design file, should not be changed.
3. ahb_slave_with_pcie  - Qsys file you will need to load when open the Qsys tool.
4. master_example.qpf 	- This is the main Quartus Project File. 
5. master_example.sdc 	- Design Contraints file for timing analysis in Quartus.
6. master_example.sv  	- Top level netlist (FPGA wrapper)
7. AHB_slave.sv      - AHB interface IP we created, normally you should not change these files.
8. fifo.v    - FIFO wrapper of Altera FIFO IP. You should not change it.
9. avalon_ahb_bridge.sv    - Bridge design files we created to connect your AHB components to Avalon bus in the Qsys integration. They should not be changed.

10. user_logic.sv          - User logic module. This one will be replaced by your own design.
11. top_level.sv           - the top level file thats connects your user_logic to the AHB interfaces. This file will be the module dropped in the Qsys. You will need to change it when do your design integration.
