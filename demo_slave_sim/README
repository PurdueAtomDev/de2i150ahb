	README - Brief description of the directory layout and files needed
*******************************************************************************


This directory has the following layout :

./


1. AHB_slave.sv           - AHB interface IPs we created, normally you should not change these files.
2. fifo.v                 - FIFO wrappers of Altera FIFO IP. You should not change them.
3. user_logic.sv          - User logic module. This one will be replaced by your own design.
4. ahb_frbm.sv            - the AHB file reading master. It feeds test cases to your user modules. This file should not be changed.

5. top_level.sv           - this is the test bench you will need to simulate in Modelsim. When you test your designs, make sure you change it accordingly.

6. burst_test.tic         - actual test cases your ahb_frbm.sv will read.
7. AHB_slave_demo_run_msim_rtl_verilog.do     - script to load when you simulate in Modelsim, you may need to change it.
